There's not much to say, this is a small project I made for my 4 year old who really has a thing for mazes. It uses the HTML5 Canvas feature to draw the game board. The method of maze generation is simple randomized Prims.

I'd like to make a few controls to tweak a few things on the fly but this was good enough to get going.
